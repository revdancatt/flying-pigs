## About

So, this is a bit of a weird one, stick with me a moment.

It's Christmas time, I'm on holiday, everyone is chill and not much is going on. I'm looking around fxhash and this project pops up [PETPIGS](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/petpigs). The kids are sitting with me on the sofa and it catches their attention. We sit and flick through the possible, and yet still random, variations and they say which ones they like, and can I buy them one. I say I can try, but the results are random. Plus it's late and everyone needs to go to bed.

The next morning the pigs are still there, not a single one sold. So I buy one.

Then another, and another, trying to get the type my kids wanted.

At which point I was "If I buy all the pigs, then I OWN all the pigs", and even more, I could do what I wanted with the pigs as it wouldn't affect anyone else. I could own all 33 PIGS.

So I hit up the the API, downloaded the details of all the pigs, recreated them in code (the original project used images, making it an image composition), then spent a happy day making a day-to-night, side scrolling flying pig scene that featured all 33 pigs, each one matching one of the 33 pigs from the original project.

I create four mints, two for myself, two that I sent to the original creator.

I was very happy, _until_ the original project then got flagged for using Stock Images and blacklisted, creating a whole set of 33 "banned" thumbnails in my collection.

But, that doesn't take away from the fact that it was a) a fun project and b) the PIGS are still flying to this day.
